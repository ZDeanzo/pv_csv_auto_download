This is a quick and dirty bash script to allow you to pull down your half hourly solar readings from the PassivLiving website. 
I created this as doing this manually is extemely long winded and this is much more efficent.

You need to copy out your token information and update the shell script.

===========================
You may need to install and use dos2unix to convert the csv to the correct carrage return.
